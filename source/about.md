I'm a software developer passionate about Scala. I live in Lausanne, Switzerland, and I currently work for Typesafe. Before that, I got my PhD at EPFL, under the supervision of prof. Martin Odersky. And before that, I grew up and studied in the beautiful city of Timisoara, Romania.

I worked on the Eclipse Scala IDE for about 4 years, and sometimes I still hack on the Scala compiler.

In my free time I enjoy rock climbing and mountaineering, playing football, and riding my (motor-)bike.
